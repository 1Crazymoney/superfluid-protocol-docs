# Introduction

Superfluid is a smart contract framework on L1 Ethereum, enabling you to move assets on-chain following predefined rules called agreements. With a single on-chain tx, the money will flow from your balance to the receiver in real time! No other tx required. Feels like magic âœ¨

![Sparkles](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/2728.svg)The first implementation of the framework consists of these key components:

* _Super Agreement Framework_: a set of white-listed _super agreements_ contracts as building blocks.
* _Super App Framework_: a development framework for building real-time finance apps.
* _Super Token Framework_: an extended [ERC-777](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777) implementation with real-time finance capability, and a registry.
* _Batch Call & Meta Tx_: for users (contracts or EOA) to interact with the system in batch on-chain, or off-chain through meta transactions.
* _Governance_: a external contract for managing protocol parameters and contract upgrades.
* _Solvency Agents_: an off-chain network of agents ensuring the solvency of the system.

# Cheat Sheet

One-liners to keep you moving along. Use these after you've set up the Superfluid SDK in Truffle console (see [tutorial](/tutorials/create-a-flow) for instructions).

### Balances

**DAI and DAIx**

    (await dai.balanceOf(bob)).toString() / 1e18
    (await daix.balanceOf(bob)).toString() / 1e18

### Flows

**`createFlow()` **

    sf.host.callAgreement(sf.agreements.cfa.address, sf.agreements.cfa.contract.methods.createFlow(daix.address, alice, "385802469135802", "0x").encodeABI(), { from: bob })

**`getNetFlow()`**

    (await sf.agreements.cfa.getNetFlow(daix.address, bob)).toString() / 1e18

**`deleteFlow()`**

        sf.host.callAgreement(sf.agreements.cfa.address, sf.agreements.cfa.contract.methods.deleteFlow(daix.address, bob, alice, "0x").encodeABI(), { from: bob })

### Instant Distributions

# Agreements

## Constant Flow Agreement (CFA)

A **Constant Flow Agreement** is a transfer of value from a `sender` to a `receiver` at a constant `flowRate` measured in _amount per second_.

#### Interface

## Instant Distribution Agreement (IDA)

An **Instant Distribution Agreement (IDA)** is used to send funds as one-time-payments. It consists of a **Publishing Index** with `indexId` and one or more **subscriptions**.
