By the end of this tutorial you will learn how to:

* Use the Superfluid javascript SDK
* Mint Superfluid DAI (DAIx)
* Open and close a Flow

## Introduction

A **Constant Flow Agreement** is a transfer of value from a `sender` to a `receiver` at a constant `flowRate` measured in _amount per second_.

Great! Now that you understand the first major concept of Superfluid, lets get to the fun part. Here is an overview of the Constant Flow Agreement contract. Did someone say _CRUD_?

```sol
interface IConstantFlowAgreementV1 {
  function createFlow( ...
  function updateFlow( ...
  function deleteFlow( ...
}
```

Seem straightforward enough? Let's take the contracts for a test-drive.

## Set Up

The Superfluid contracts have already been deployed on the GÃ¶rli testnet for you. Here are the steps we'll take to get set up:

1. Install the SDK
2. Obtain Gorli ETH
3. Open Truffle console
4. Mint some Superfluid DAI (DAIx)

### Install the SDK

Download the example repo, which includes the Superfluid JavaScript software development kit.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/superfluid-finance/superfluid-protocol-preview/
cd superfluid-protocol-preview/ethereum-contracts && yarn install
```

If you haven't already, install truffle and jq.

```bash
sudo apt-get install jq
npm i -g truffle
```

The contracts have already been built and are located in the `/build` folder (note: the contract source code may not be included).

### Obtain GÃ¶rli ETH

Before we can get testnet ETH, we need a 12-word mnemonic to create some test wallets. If you don't have a mnemonic, we can use Truffle to create one.

    truffle develop
    
    > Accounts:
    > (0) 0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57
    > (1) 0xf17f52151ebef6c7334fad080c5704d77216b732
    
    > Mnemonic: rigid cradle south ...

Copy the first address and use one of the GÃ¶rli testnet faucets listed at [https://goerli.net/](https://goerli.net/ "https://goerli.net/") to obtain some ETH.

Exit the truffle develop tool before continuing.

Now create a file named `.env` and add your mnemonic and web3 provider for GÃ¶rli network.

    GOERLI_MNEMONIC=rigid cradle south ...
    GOERLI_PROVIDER_URL=https://goerli.infura.io/v3/<API_KEY>

### Open Truffle console

We are ready to open the Truffle console.

```bash
npx truffle --network goerli console
```

Let's load the SDK and initialize it with the contracts.

```bash
SuperfluidSDK = require(".")

sf = new SuperfluidSDK.Framework({version: "preview-20200928", web3Provider: web3.currentProvider })

await sf.initialize()

> Resolver at 0xDC200aA39Aa1D9B28CE458979602eb79046A1C9f
> Resolving contracts with version preview-20200928
> Superfluid 0xa401e671eCA4309BDdADA860d5B25C722118b5A1
> ConstantFlowAgreementV1 0x33A225eAcDbB27B48503Dd9D1d028D5fa35754b0
> InstantDistributionAgreementV1 0x1354e201Ca565773D29C573FE9278D04f03E62F5
```

> What just happened? The Superfluid SDK used the `resolver` contract deployed on GÃ¶rli to fetch all the Superfluid contracts for the version "preview-20200928". Then the contract objects were created using the Truffle artifacts in the `/build` folder.

Now we'll load a web3 utility library and create an alias for two of our wallet addresses.

```bash
const { toWad, toBN, fromWad, wad4human } = require("@decentral.ee/web3-helpers")

bob = accounts[0]
alice = accounts[1]
dan = accounts[2]
```

### Mint some DAIx (Superfluid DAI)

For this tutorial, we'll be using an ERC20 token "fake DAI" to represent DAI. Let's get the address for this token using the resolver, and create a Truffle contract object so we can interact with it.

```bash
daiAddress = await sf.resolver.get("tokens.fDAI")
dai = await sf.contracts.TestToken.at(daiAddress)
```

Let's mint bob 100 DAI (minting is open for anyone to call).

```bash
dai.mint(bob, web3.utils.toWei("100", "ether"), { from: bob })

# Check bob's balance
(async () => (wad4human(await dai.balanceOf(bob))))()
> '100.00000'
```

Now bob has some normal DAI.

![](/img/cmon.png)

Before we can use DAI with Superfluid, we need to **upgrade** it to the Superfluid version "DAIx".

This is done using a `SuperToken` wrapper contract. Generally, there is a single wrapper for each ERC20. Let's get the SuperToken wrapper for DAI.

```bash
daixWrapper = await sf.getERC20Wrapper(dai)
daix = await sf.contracts.ISuperToken.at(daixWrapper.wrapperAddress)
```

Now we can upgrade 50 of bob's DAI by calling `approve()` followed by `upgrade()`

```bash
dai.approve(daix.address, "1"+"0".repeat(42), { from: bob })

daix.upgrade(web3.utils.toWei("50", "ether"), { from: bob })

# Check DAIx balance
(async () => (wad4human(await daix.balanceOf(bob))))()
> '50.00000'
```

Hurrah, we now have 50 Superfluid-enabled DAI or "DAIx". We are ready to start using Superfluid.

## Create a Constant Flow Agreement "CFA"

Now that bob has some Superfluid-enabled DAI, he wants to send 100 DAIx per month to alice.

### createFlow()

To achieve this, we will create a **Constant Flow Agreement**. In this agreement, we define the _amount per second_ and `recipient` where DAIx should flow.

```bash
sf.host.callAgreement(sf.agreements.cfa.address, sf.agreements.cfa.contract.methods.createFlow(daix.address, alice, "385802469135802", "0x").encodeABI(), { from: bob })
```

Here is the breakdown:

1. A flow is a type of agreement, so we use `callAgreement()`
2. We specify we want a **Constant Flow Agreement** by selecting `sf.agreements.cfa.address`
3. Using the method `createFlow()`, we pass the arguments for the DAIx token, recipient, and the amount "385802469135802"

So what is this weird number "385802469135802"? This is the amount of DAIx to transfer per second, which is equivalent to 100 DAIx per month.

```python
>>> (385802469135802 * 3600 * 24 * 30) / 10e18
99.99999999999989 DAIx per month
```

> HUH?! How is bob able to send 100 DAIx per month if he only has 50 Superfluid enabled DAI? The answer is that the sender isn't required to have the full amount to start a flow. The flow will continue to run as long as he has DAIx.

#### ðŸŽ‰ Excellent work, you just started your first Superfluid Flow!

### Inspect the Flow

The flow is now active, so let's check alice and bob's balances to see what changed. Their balances are updated every second, and reflected on-chain at every new block.

```bash
(await daix.balanceOf(bob)).toString() / 1e18
> 48.36226851851852
(await daix.balanceOf(alice)).toString() / 1e18
> 0.2546296296296293
```

> Note: These amounts will not add up to 50 DAIx, due to a refundable deposit.

To get an idea of all Flow activity for bob, we can check his **net flow**. This will show us the sum of all inflow/outflows for his account.

We can use `getNetFlow()` to see the flow we just created.

```bash
(await sf.agreements.cfa.getNetFlow(daix.address, bob)).toString() / 10e18
> -0.0000385802469135802 # units of wei
```

Since he only has one flow to alice, his net flow is negative. If bob had multiple flows, this would be an easy way to get an overall picture of bob's activity.

### Stop the Flow

Now lets stop the flow by deleting it. Call `deleteFlow()` and select the flow between bob and alice.

    sf.host.callAgreement(sf.agreements.cfa.address, sf.agreements.cfa.contract.methods.deleteFlow(daix.address, bob, alice, "0x").encodeABI(), { from: bob })

If we check their balances, we'll see that they now add up to 50 since the refundable deposit has been returned.

```bash
(await daix.balanceOf(bob)).toString() / 1e18
> 49.53125
(await daix.balanceOf(alice)).toString() / 1e18
> 0.4745370370370365
```

Great job! You minted some Superfluid-enabled DAI, and created your first Flow.

Next we'll learn about another agreement, called **Instant Distribution**
