---# Instant Distribution

> If you want to reset ganache, now is a good time to do so! Bear in mind you'll need to redeploy the SF contracts if you do.

The first step to creating an Instant Distribution Agreement (IDA) is to create a **publishing index**. Once created, the publishing index will be used by bob to send tokens at some point in the future.

Create a new reference index from bob using `createIndex`

```bash
sf.host.callAgreement(sf.agreements.ida.address, sf.agreements.ida.contract.methods.createIndex(daix.address, 42, "0x").encodeABI(), { from: bob })
```

Here bob is the "publisher" since he is creating the "index" #42.

Alice is now given some "units" using `updateSubscription`

> (??) "Units" behave the same as stock "shares"

```bash
sf.host.callAgreement(sf.agreements.ida.address, sf.agreements.ida.contract.methods.updateSubscription(daix.address, 42, alice, 100, "0x").encodeABI(), { from: bob })
```

Dan is given some units too, however he did not `approveSubscription`

```bash
sf.host.callAgreement(sf.agreements.ida.address, sf.agreements.ida.contract.methods.updateSubscription(daix.address, 42, dan, 200, "0x").encodeABI(), { from: bob })
```

Now alice will subscribe using `approveSubscription`.

```bash
sf.host.callAgreement(sf.agreements.ida.address, sf.agreements.ida.contract.methods.approveSubscription(daix.address, bob, 42, "0x").encodeABI(), { from: alice })
```

Check balances before the distribution occurs.

```bash
(await daix.balanceOf(bob)).toString() / 1e18
> 50
(await daix.balanceOf(alice)).toString() / 1e18
> 0
(await daix.balanceOf(dan)).toString() / 1e18
> 0
```

New we will actually perform an Instant Distribution. We use `updateIndex` with a value of **0.01 ETH**. The link

```bash
sf.host.callAgreement(sf.agreements.ida.address, sf.agreements.ida.contract.methods.updateIndex(daix.address, 42, web3.utils.toWei("0.01", "ether"), "0x").encodeABI(), { from: bob })
```

0.01 DAI/Units (the new index value we called) _ 300 Total Units = 3 DAI being distributed
Since alice owns 100 Units, she earns 100 / 300 _ 3 DAI = 1 DAI
Since dan owns 200 Units, he earns 200 / 300 \* 3 DAI = 2 DAI

Lets check the balances to confirm.

```bash
(await daix.balanceOf(alice)).toString() / 1e18
> 1
(await daix.balanceOf(dan)).toString() / 1e18
> 0
```

Dan has not received his DAI in the context of the token `balanceOf`, since he has not called `approveSubscription` for this index. He _does own 2 DAI_ but the SF contracts did not actually distribute it to him.

> SF Contracts Tip: Every account can only subscribe to a total of 256 indexes. This is why the SF contracts cannot automatically distribute the DAI to Dan. It is a prevention mechanism to keep spammers from "filling" up a users 256 subscriptions.

> Alternatively, whenever bob updates the index, the SF contracts will see that there is an unclaimed distribution, and will perform the distribution automatically as a side-effect during the index update.

To perform another distribution we must increase the index amount. To send another 1 DAI to alice and 1 DAI to dan we must \_increment the index by 0.01** for a **total of 0.02\_\_

```bash
sf.host.callAgreement(sf.agreements.ida.address, sf.agreements.ida.contract.methods.updateIndex(daix.address, 42, web3.utils.toWei("0.02", "ether"), "0x").encodeABI(), { from: bob })
```

The total amount distributed to dan is now 100 units _ 0.02 = 2 DAI
The total amount distributed to dan is now 200 units _ 0.02 = 4 DAI

TODO: simplify the example to not have this weird dan scenario. It can be added later.

Lets check the balances to confirm.

```bash
(await daix.balanceOf(alice)).toString() / 1e18
> 2
(await daix.balanceOf(dan)).toString() / 1e18
> 4
```

### Create an App

Now create an example app. "cfa" is constant flow agreement

```bash
mfa = await MultiFlowsApp.new(sf.agreements.cfa.address, sf.host.address)

# Create a flow
sf.host.callAppAction(mfa.address, mfa.contract.methods.createMultiFlows(daix.wrapperAddress, [alice, carol], [6,4], "0x").encodeABI(), { from: bob })
```

The app is now configured, so when Bob sends a constant flow to MFA app, it will split the flow between alice and carol, with a ratio of 6:4

```bash
sf.host.callAgreement(sf.agreements.cfa.address, sf.agreements.cfa.contract.methods.createFlow(daix.wrapperAddress, mfa.address, "385802469135802", "0x").encodeABI(), { from: bob })
```

TBC

By default Ganache doesn't mint blocks, so we need to use a convenience command to progress "-b" blocks automatically

> -b, --blockTime Block time in seconds for automatic mining. Will instantly mine a new block for every transaction if option omitted. Avoid using unless your test cases require a specific
