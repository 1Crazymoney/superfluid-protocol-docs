By the end of this tutorial you will learn:

* How to use the Superfluid javascript SDK
* How to open and close a Flow

## Introduction

A **Constant Flow Agreement** is a transfer of value from a `sender` to a `receiver` at a constant `flowRate` measured in _amount per second_.

Great! Now that you understand the first major concept of Superfluid, lets get to the fun part. Here is an overview of the Constant Flow Agreement contract. Did someone say _CRUD_?

```sol
interface IConstantFlowAgreementV1 {
  function createFlow( ...
  function updateFlow( ...
  function deleteFlow( ...
}
```

Seem straightforward enough? Let's take the contracts for a test-drive.

## Set Up

The Superfluid contracts have already been deployed on the GÃ¶rli testnet for you. Here are the steps we'll take:

1. Install SDK
2. Obtain Gorli ETH
3. Open Truffle console
4. Mint some Superfluid DAI (DAIx)

### Install the SDK

Download the example repo, which includes the SDK

```bash
git clone REPO URL PLACEHOLDER
cd PLACEHOLDER && npm i
```

If you haven't already, install truffle and jq.

```bash
sudo apt-get install jq
npm i -g truffle
```

Now build the contracts using truffle.

```bash
yarn build
```

### Obtain GÃ¶rli ETH

Before we can get testnet ETH, we need a 12-word mnemonic to generate our wallets. If you don't have a mnemonic, we can use truffle to create one for us. Never put any real funds into it.

    truffle develop
    
    > Accounts:
    > (0) 0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57
    > (1) 0xf17f52151ebef6c7334fad080c5704d77216b732
    
    > Mnemonic: rigid cradle south tribe juice harvest unit walk section grab quiz wire

Copy the first address and use the GÃ¶rli testnet faucet to obtain some ETH https://goerli.net/

Exit the truffle develop tool before continuing.

### Open Truffle console

Now we are ready to open the Truffle console

```bash
npx truffle --network goerli console -mnemonic "rigid cradle south ..."
```

Let's load the SDK and initialize it with the contracts.

```bash
SuperfluidSDK = require(".")

sf = new SuperfluidSDK.Framework({version: "PLACEHOLDER_VERSION", web3Provider: web3.currentProvider })

await sf.initialize()

> Resolver at 0xF935...
> Resolving contracts with version test
> Superfluid 0xC38B...
> ConstantFlowAgreementV1 0x7E...
> InstantDistributionAgreementV1 0xA0D..
```

> What just happened? The SF SDK used the `resolver` contract deployed on GÃ¶rli to fetch all the relevant protocol addresses. Then the Truffle artifacts in the `/build` folder were used to create each contract object.

Now we'll load a web3 utility library and create an alias for two of our wallet addresses.

```bash
const { toWad, toBN, fromWad, wad4human } = require("@decentral.ee/web3-helpers")

bob = accounts[0]
alice = accounts[1]
```

### Mint some DAIx (Superfluid DAI)

For this tutorial, our Flow will be using an ERC20 token called "fake DAI" or just fDAI for short. Let's get the address for this token using the resolver, and create a Truffle contract object so we can interact with it.

```bash
daiAddress = await sf.resolver.get("tokens.fDAI")
dai = await sf.contracts.TestToken.at(daiAddress)
```

Let's mint bob 100 DAI (minting is open for anyone to call here)

```bash
dai.mint(bob, web3.utils.toWei("100", "ether"), { from: bob })

(async () => (wad4human(await dai.balanceOf(bob))))()
> '100.00000'
```

Now bob has some boring DAI.

Let's **upgrade** our DAI token so it can get Superfluid capabilities. First we need to get the wrapped DAI contract using the `SuperToken` wrapper.

```bash
daixWrapper = await sf.getERC20Wrapper(dai)
daix = await sf.contracts.ISuperToken.at(daixWrapper.wrapperAddress)
```

Now we can upgrade half of bob's DAI.

```bash
dai.approve(daix.address, "1"+"0".repeat(42), { from: bob })

daix.upgrade(web3.utils.toWei("50", "ether"), { from: bob })

(async () => (wad4human(await daix.balanceOf(bob))))()
> '50.00000'
```

Hurrah, we now have 50 Superfluid DAI or "DAIx" ðŸ¦¸.

We're almost to the finish line, stick with it!

## Create a Constant Flow Agreement "CFA"

Now that bob has some Superfluid-enabled DAI, he wants to send 100 DAI per month to alice.

### createFlow()

To achieve this, we will create a **Constant Flow Agreement**. In this, we will define the _amount per second_ and `recipient` which the DAI should flow to.

```bash
sf.host.callAgreement(sf.agreements.cfa.address, sf.agreements.cfa.contract.methods.createFlow(daix.address, alice, "385802469135802", "0x").encodeABI(), { from: bob })
```

If we unwind this command, we'll see that the main points are:

1. We made a call to the `host` contract using `callAgreements`
2. We specify we want to use a **Constant Flow Agreement** with `cfa.address`
3. We are using the method `createFlow`, and pass the arguments for the DAI token, recipient, and the amount "385802469135802"

So what is this weird number "385802469135802"? This is the amount of DAI to transfer per second, which is equivalent to 100 DAI per month.

```python
>>> (385802469135802 * 3600 * 24 * 30) / 10e18
99.99999999999989
```

> HUH?! How is bob able to send 100 DAI per month if he only has 50 Superfluid enabled DAI? The answer is that the sender isn't required to have the full amount to start a flow. The flow will continue to run as long as he has DAI.

### Inspect the Flow

The flow is now active, so let's check alice and bob's balances to see the change. Their balances will be updated every second.

```bash
(await daix.balanceOf(bob)).toString() / 1e18
> 48.55092592592593
(await daix.balanceOf(alice)).toString() / 1e18
> 0.006674382716049375
```

> Note: These amounts should not add up to bob's original balance of 50 SuperDAI, due to a refundable deposit which will be explained in a later tutorial.

To get an idea of all Flow activity for bob, we can check his `net flow`. This will show us the sum of all inflow/outflows for his account. Here we can see the flow we just created, with the same "385802469135802" in units of wei.

```bash
(await sf.agreements.cfa.getNetFlow(daix.address, bob)).toString() / 10e18
> -0.0000385802469135802
```

If bob had multiple flows, this would be reflected here. Since his net flow is negative, he'll need to remember to keep enough DAI in his wallet!

### Stop the Flow

Now lets stop the flow by deleting it. We call `deleteFlow` and select the flow between bob and alice.

    sf.host.callAgreement(sf.agreements.cfa.address, sf.agreements.cfa.contract.methods.deleteFlow(daix.address, bob, alice, "0x").encodeABI(), { from: bob })

If we check their balances, we'll see that they now add up to 50 since the refundable deposit has been returned.

```bash
(await daix.balanceOf(bob)).toString() / 1e18
> 47.316580926
(await daix.balanceOf(alice)).toString() / 1e18
> 2.683419074
```

Great job! You just minted some Superfluid-enabled DAI, and created your first Flow.
