# Introduction

Superfluid is a smart contract framework on L1 Ethereum, enabling you to move assets on-chain following predefined rules called agreements With a single on-chain tx, the money will flow from your balance to the receiver in real time! No other tx required Feels like magic ‚ú® Superfluid enables:

üí∏ **Real money streaming** - constant flows on-chain with no capital lockups.

üéÅ **Rewards distributions** - Fixed cost distribution in a single transaction for any number of receivers.

üîÆ **Anything you can imagine** - Superfluid is very flexible!

The initial version of Superfluid is comprised of the following key elements: 

* _Super Agreement Framework_: a set of white-listed _super agreements_ contracts as building blocks.
* _Super App Framework_: a development framework for building real-time finance apps.
* _Super Token Framework_: an extended [ERC-777](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777) implementation with real-time finance capability, and a registry.
* _Batch Call & Meta Tx_: for users (contracts or EOA) to interact with the system in batch on-chain, or off-chain through meta transactions.
* _Governance_: a external contract for managing protocol parameters and contract upgrades.
* _Solvency Agents_: an off-chain network of agents ensuring the solvency of the system.

# Cheat Sheet

One-liners to keep you "in the flow".

### Set Up

Quickly get set up with the Superfluid SDK in Truffle console. See the [tutorial](/tutorial/create-a-flow) for a full walk-through.

    # TODO

### Tokens

**`balanceOf()`**

    (await daix.balanceOf(bob)).toString() / 1e18
    (await dai.balanceOf(bob)).toString() / 1e18

**`upgrade()`**

    dai.approve(daix.address, "1"+"0".repeat(42), { from: bob })
    daix.upgrade(web3.utils.toWei("50", "ether"), { from: bob })

### Flows

**`createFlow()`**

    sf.host.callAgreement(sf.agreements.cfa.address, sf.agreements.cfa.contract.methods.createFlow(daix.address, alice, "385802469135802", "0x").encodeABI(), { from: bob })

**`deleteFlow()`**

    sf.host.callAgreement(sf.agreements.cfa.address, sf.agreements.cfa.contract.methods.deleteFlow(daix.address, bob, alice, "0x").encodeABI(), { from: bob })

**`getNetFlow()`**

    (await sf.agreements.cfa.getNetFlow(daix.address, bob)).toString() / 1e18

### Instant Distributions

**`createIndex()`** (sent from _publisher)_

    sf.host.callAgreement(sf.agreements.ida.address, sf.agreements.ida.contract.methods.createIndex(daix.address, 42, "0x").encodeABI(), { from: bob })

**`updateSubscription()`** (sent from _publisher)_

    sf.host.callAgreement(sf.agreements.ida.address, sf.agreements.ida.contract.methods.updateSubscription(daix.address, 42, dan, 100, "0x").encodeABI(), { from: bob })

**`approveSubscription()`** (sent from _subscriber)_

    sf.host.callAgreement(sf.agreements.ida.address, sf.agreements.ida.contract.methods.approveSubscription(daix.address, bob, 42, "0x").encodeABI(), { from: alice })

**`updateIndex()`** (sent from _publisher)_

    sf.host.callAgreement(sf.agreements.ida.address, sf.agreements.ida.contract.methods.updateIndex(daix.address, 42, web3.utils.toWei("0.01", "ether"), "0x").encodeABI(), { from: bob })

**`claim()`** (sent from _subscriber)_

    sf.host.callAgreement(sf.agreements.ida.address, sf.agreements.ida.contract.methods.claim(daix.address, bob, 42, "0x").encodeABI(), { from: dan })

# Agreements

## Constant Flow Agreement (CFA)

A **Constant Flow Agreement** is a transfer of value from a `sender` to a `receiver` at a constant `flowRate` measured in _amount per second_.

## Instant Distribution Agreement (IDA)

An **Instant Distribution Agreement (IDA)** is used to send funds as one-time-payments. It consists of a **Publishing Index** with `indexId`, an `indexValue`, and one or more **subscribers**.
