# ü¶æ Super Apps

A Super App can "manage" agreements and respond to changes. This is where you can write your own custom logic/behavior. In this section we will deploy a new Super App using Remix. Our app will accept incoming CFA flows, and use the smart contract logic to determine where to redirect it.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial you should: 

* Have some goerli ETH and tokens in your wallet from the dashboard [https://app.superfluid.finance](https://app.superfluid.finance)

## Setup

Click the link to load the contracts in Remix:

Once it loads, you should see `TradeableCashflow.sol` in the editor window. 

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%281%29.png)

Open the gist in the file explorer to see all the contracts. `TradeableCashflow.sol` is our main contract, which inherits `RedirectAll` from the local file, and the `ERC721` contract from the Open Zeppelin Github repo.

The two main components you should understand in `TradeableCashflow.sol` are:

1. Create a new ERC721 and mint a single NFT 
2. Whenever we transfer the NFT, the `_beforeTokenTransfer()` hook will call `_changeReceiver()` 

Ok, so let's look at what `_changeReceiver()` does in `RedirectAll.sol`

```javascript
    // @dev Change the Receiver of the total flow
    function _changeReceiver( address newReceiver ) internal {
        // Some internal checking    
        // ...
        // @dev delete flow to old receiver
        _host.callAgreement(
            _cfa,
            abi.encodeWithSelector(
                _cfa.deleteFlow.selector,
                _acceptedToken,
                address(this),
                _receiver,
                new bytes(0)
            ),
            "0x"
        );
        // @dev create flow to new receiver
        _host.callAgreement(
            _cfa,
            abi.encodeWithSelector(
                _cfa.createFlow.selector,
                _acceptedToken,
                newReceiver,
                _cfa.getNetFlow(_acceptedToken, address(this)),
                new bytes(0)
            ),
            "0x"
        );
        // @dev set global receiver to new receiver
        _receiver = newReceiver;

        emit ReceiverChanged(_receiver);
    }
```

The notation here will look different from what we've covered so far, since we are interacting with the contracts directly. In comparison, here's how it would look using `@superfluid-finance/js-sdk` :

```javascript
// Get the new incoming flow rate
const newFlowRate = await sf.cfa.getNetFlow({ 
                        superToken: _acceptedToken,
                        account: myContract.address
                      })

// Stop flow to the current recipient
await flow({recipient: recipient, flowRate: "0" });

// Start a flow to the new recipient
await flow({recipient: newRecipient, flowRate: newFlowRate });

// Reassign the recipient to the newRecipient
recipient = newRecipient
```

Now we see how to update flows using a contract. But what about reacting to incoming flows automatically? To respond to changes in an agreement, we need to use Super App **callbacks**.

## Callbacks

This is how your app can respond to someone opening a new flow, _without needing to call a function on the contract itself_. For example, a user can simply start a new flow to your contract using the dashboard, and this can trigger business logic within your contract automatically.

## Deployment

Now that we have a basic idea of how our Super App works, its time to take it for a spin!

Switch back to `TradeableCashflow.sol` in the editor window. Now in the Compiler tab, make sure you're using the same version as whats listed in the contract, and hit "compile".

To deploy the contract, switch to the "Deploy and Run Transactions" tab, and select ‚ÄúInjected Web3‚Äù. In your wallet, make sure you're on the Goerli test network. Here are the parameters you should use to deploy:

* Host: 0x22ff293e14F1EC3A09B137e9e06084AFd63adDF9
* CFA: 0xEd6BcbF6907D4feEEe8a8875543249bEa9D308E8
* Accepted Token \(fDAIx\): 0xf2d68898557ccb2cf4c10c3ef2b034b2a69dad00

## Usage

From any account, start a flow using the _acceptedToken_ **fDAIx**, to the address of the deployed contract.

Once you transfer the NFT, the flow will update automatically to the new Holy Grail holder.
