By the end of this tutorial you will learn how to:

\* Use the Superfluid javascript SDK

\* Mint Superfluid DAI (DAIx)

\* Perform an instant distribution

## Introduction

An **Instant Distribution Agreement (IDA)** is used to send funds as a one-time-payment.

## Set Up

> Skip this section if you've already set up your Truffle console with the Superfluid SDK.

The Superfluid contracts have already been deployed on the GÃ¶rli testnet for you. Here are the steps we'll take to get set up:

1. Install the SDK
2. Obtain Gorli ETH
3. Open Truffle console
4. Mint some Superfluid DAI (DAIx)

### Install the SDK

Download the example repo, which includes the Superfluid JavaScript software development kit.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/superfluid-finance/superfluid-protocol-preview/
cd superfluid-protocol-preview/ethereum-contracts && yarn install
```

If you haven't already, install truffle and jq.

```bash
sudo apt-get install jq
npm i -g truffle
```

The contracts have already been built and are located in the `/build` folder (note: the contract source code may not be included).

### Obtain GÃ¶rli ETH

Before we can get testnet ETH, we need a 12-word mnemonic to create some test wallets. If you don't have a mnemonic, we can use Truffle to create one.

    truffle develop
    
    > Accounts:
    > (0) 0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57
    > (1) 0xf17f52151ebef6c7334fad080c5704d77216b732
    
    > Mnemonic: rigid cradle south ...

Copy the first address and use one of the GÃ¶rli testnet faucets listed at [https://goerli.net/](https://goerli.net/ "https://goerli.net/") to obtain some ETH.

Exit the truffle develop tool before continuing.

Now create a file named `.env` and add your mnemonic and web3 provider for GÃ¶rli network.

    GOERLI_MNEMONIC=rigid cradle south ...
    GOERLI_PROVIDER_URL=https://goerli.infura.io/v3/<API_KEY>

### Open Truffle console

We are ready to open the Truffle console.

```bash
npx truffle --network goerli console
```

Let's load the SDK and initialize it with the contracts.

```bash
SuperfluidSDK = require(".")

sf = new SuperfluidSDK.Framework({version: "preview-20200928", web3Provider: web3.currentProvider })

await sf.initialize()

> Resolver at 0xDC200aA39Aa1D9B28CE458979602eb79046A1C9f
> Resolving contracts with version preview-20200928
> Superfluid 0xa401e671eCA4309BDdADA860d5B25C722118b5A1
> ConstantFlowAgreementV1 0x33A225eAcDbB27B48503Dd9D1d028D5fa35754b0
> InstantDistributionAgreementV1 0x1354e201Ca565773D29C573FE9278D04f03E62F5
```

> What just happened? The Superfluid SDK used the `resolver` contract deployed on GÃ¶rli to fetch all the Superfluid contracts for the version "preview-20200928". Then the contract objects were created using the Truffle artifacts in the `/build` folder.

Now we'll load a web3 utility library and create an alias for two of our wallet addresses.

```bash
const { toWad, toBN, fromWad, wad4human } = require("@decentral.ee/web3-helpers")

bob = accounts[0]
alice = accounts[1]
```

### Mint some DAIx (Superfluid DAI)

For this tutorial, we'll be using an ERC20 token "fake DAI" to represent DAI. Let's get the address for this token using the resolver, and create a Truffle contract object so we can interact with it.

```bash
daiAddress = await sf.resolver.get("tokens.fDAI")
dai = await sf.contracts.TestToken.at(daiAddress)
```

Let's mint bob 100 DAI (minting is open for anyone to call).

```bash
dai.mint(bob, web3.utils.toWei("100", "ether"), { from: bob })

# Check bob's balance
(async () => (wad4human(await dai.balanceOf(bob))))()
> '100.00000'
```

Now bob has some normal DAI.

Before we can use DAI with Superfluid, we need to **upgrade** it to the Superfluid version "DAIx".

This is done using a `SuperToken` wrapper contract. Generally, there is a single wrapper for each ERC20. Let's get the SuperToken wrapper for DAI.

```bash
daixWrapper = await sf.getERC20Wrapper(dai)
daix = await sf.contracts.ISuperToken.at(daixWrapper.wrapperAddress)
```

Now we can upgrade 50 of bob's DAI by calling `approve()` followed by `upgrade()`

```bash
dai.approve(daix.address, "1"+"0".repeat(42), { from: bob })

daix.upgrade(web3.utils.toWei("50", "ether"), { from: bob })

# Check DAIx balance
(async () => (wad4human(await daix.balanceOf(bob))))()
> '50.00000'
```

Hurrah, we now have 50 Superfluid-enabled DAI or "DAIx". We are ready to start using SuperFluid.

## Perform an Instant Distribution

> If you have any active flows, please stop them before continuing.

The first step to creating an Instant Distribution Agreement (IDA) is to create a **publishing index**. Once created, the publishing index will be used by bob to send tokens at some point in the future.

Create a new index from bob using `createIndex()`. Bob is the _publisher_ since he is creating the index.

```bash
sf.host.callAgreement(sf.agreements.ida.address, sf.agreements.ida.contract.methods.createIndex(daix.address, 42, "0x").encodeABI(), { from: bob })
```

Here is the breakdown:

1. An Instant Distribution is a type of agreement, so we use `callAgreement()`
2. We specify we want an **Instant Distribution Agreement** by selecting `sf.agreements.ida.address`
3. Using the method `createIndex()`, we pass the arguments for the DAIx token, and the index ID.

Alice is now given some "units" using `updateSubscription()`

> (??) "Units" behave the same as stock "shares"

```bash
sf.host.callAgreement(sf.agreements.ida.address, sf.agreements.ida.contract.methods.updateSubscription(daix.address, 42, alice, 100, "0x").encodeABI(), { from: bob })
```

Dan is given some units too, however he did not `approveSubscription()`

```bash
sf.host.callAgreement(sf.agreements.ida.address, sf.agreements.ida.contract.methods.updateSubscription(daix.address, 42, dan, 200, "0x").encodeABI(), { from: bob })
```

Now alice will subscribe using `approveSubscription()`.

```bash
sf.host.callAgreement(sf.agreements.ida.address, sf.agreements.ida.contract.methods.approveSubscription(daix.address, bob, 42, "0x").encodeABI(), { from: alice })
```

Check balances before the distribution occurs.

```bash
(await daix.balanceOf(bob)).toString() / 1e18
> 50
(await daix.balanceOf(alice)).toString() / 1e18
> 0
(await daix.balanceOf(dan)).toString() / 1e18
> 0
```

New we will actually perform an Instant Distribution. We use `updateIndex` with a value of **0.01 ETH**. The link

```bash
sf.host.callAgreement(sf.agreements.ida.address, sf.agreements.ida.contract.methods.updateIndex(daix.address, 42, web3.utils.toWei("0.01", "ether"), "0x").encodeABI(), { from: bob })
```

0\.01 DAI/Units (the new index value we called) _ 300 Total Units = 3 DAI being distributed
Since alice owns 100 Units, she earns 100 / 300 _ 3 DAI = 1 DAI
Since dan owns 200 Units, he earns 200 / 300 * 3 DAI = 2 DAI

Lets check the balances to confirm.

```bash
(await daix.balanceOf(alice)).toString() / 1e18
> 1
(await daix.balanceOf(dan)).toString() / 1e18
> 0
```

Dan has not received his DAI in the context of the token `balanceOf`, since he has not called `approveSubscription` for this index. He _does own 2 DAI_ but the SF contracts did not actually distribute it to him.

> SF Contracts Tip: Every account can only subscribe to a total of 256 indexes. This is why the SF contracts cannot automatically distribute the DAI to Dan. It is a prevention mechanism to keep spammers from "filling" up a users 256 subscriptions.

> Alternatively, whenever bob updates the index, the SF contracts will see that there is an unclaimed distribution, and will perform the distribution automatically as a side-effect during the index update.

To perform another distribution we must increase the index amount. To send another 1 DAI to alice and 1 DAI to dan we must _increment the index by 0.01** for a **total of 0.02__

```bash
sf.host.callAgreement(sf.agreements.ida.address, sf.agreements.ida.contract.methods.updateIndex(daix.address, 42, web3.utils.toWei("0.02", "ether"), "0x").encodeABI(), { from: bob })
```

The total amount distributed to dan is now 100 units _ 0.02 = 2 DAI
The total amount distributed to dan is now 200 units _ 0.02 = 4 DAI

TODO: simplify the example to not have this weird dan scenario. It can be added later.

Lets check the balances to confirm.

```bash
(await daix.balanceOf(alice)).toString() / 1e18
> 2
(await daix.balanceOf(dan)).toString() / 1e18
> 4
```

### Create an App

Now create an example app. "cfa" is constant flow agreement

```bash
mfa = await MultiFlowsApp.new(sf.agreements.cfa.address, sf.host.address)

# Create a flow
sf.host.callAppAction(mfa.address, mfa.contract.methods.createMultiFlows(daix.wrapperAddress, [alice, carol], [6,4], "0x").encodeABI(), { from: bob })
```

The app is now configured, so when Bob sends a constant flow to MFA app, it will split the flow between alice and carol, with a ratio of 6:4

```bash
sf.host.callAgreement(sf.agreements.cfa.address, sf.agreements.cfa.contract.methods.createFlow(daix.wrapperAddress, mfa.address, "385802469135802", "0x").encodeABI(), { from: bob })
```

TBC

By default Ganache doesn't mint blocks, so we need to use a convenience command to progress "-b" blocks automatically

> -b, --blockTime Block time in seconds for automatic mining. Will instantly mine a new block for every transaction if option omitted. Avoid using unless your test cases require a specific
