## What is Superfluid?

The Superfluid Protocol is a framework that realises this real-time finance vision in practice. The first implementation of the framework is on Ethereum, it consists of these key components:

- _Super Agreement Framework_: a set of white-listed _super agreements_ contracts as building blocks.
- _Super App Framework_: a development framework for building real-time finance apps.
- _Super Token Framework_: an extended [ERC-777](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777) implementation with real-time finance capability, and a registry.
- _Batch Call & Meta Tx_: for users (contracts or EOA) to interact with the system in batch on-chain, or off-chain through meta transactions.
- _Governance_: a external contract for managing protocol parameters and contract upgrades.
- _Solvency Agents_: an off-chain network of agents ensuring the solvency of the system.

## Concepts

A **Constant Flow Agreement** is a transfer of value from a `sender` to a `receiver` at a constant `flowRate` measured in _amount per second_.

An **Instant Distribution Agreement (IDA)** is used to send funds as one-time-payments. It consists of an **Index** with `indexId` and one or more **subscriptions**.
